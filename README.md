# My Nix(os) Config

This is my living Nix setup, currently managing three hosts - a desktop, a
laptop and a macbook.

Inside, you'll find a complete hyprland setup for my Linux hosts, and a simple
set of work dependencies for my macbook.

## Result

The result looks something like this:

Though in practice I fullscreen the windows with a bind.

## My Config Guidelines

1. Keep things simple, until there's a reason not to
2. Familiarity beats simplicity
3. A quick working solution beats a beautiful WIP
4. Nix doesn't need to do everything
5. You can always tidy later, but you should tidy

My dotfiles, managed with [Chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/), are
