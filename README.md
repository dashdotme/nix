# My Nix(os) Config

This is my living Nix setup, currently managing three hosts - a desktop, a laptop and a macbook.

Inside, you'll find a complete hyprland setup for my Linux hosts, and a simple set of work dependencies for my macbook.

## My Config Guidelines
1) Keep things simple, until there's a reason not to
2) Familiarity beats simplicity; a quick working solution beats a beautiful WIP
  - this is part of why Nix is great; you can break complex things (setting up a custom OS) into small steps
  - you can always tidy later
3) Nix doesn't need to do everything

My dotfiles, managed with [Chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/), are [here](https://github.com/dashdotme/dotfiles).
